# Packet-Decapsulation

**Usage: python2 main.py <tcp|udp|icmp|ip|eth>**

An early prototype of a decapsulation module written in pure Python with sockets, thusfar supports layer inspection for TCP, UDP, ICMP packets, IP headers and Ethernet frames.
In its current state I do not plan on extending or planning more features upon it unless it's deemable as a necessity.
